            <InstructorDescription>
              In 2010, Mason began formal instruction with Sifu William Dere at
              UC Berkeley in taijiquan (taiji/tai chi) and is currently on staff
              as an instructor for the UC Martial Arts Program. Mason developed
              under his Neigong coach, Frank Lum, deepening his understanding of
              soft energy work. In April 2019, Mason Tong was accepted as a
              disciple of Sifu Bryant Fong, becoming a 6th generation legacy
              holder of Li Ziming Baguazhang.
              <br /> <br />
              In 2019, Mason was invited to train in Beijing at the Baguazhang
              Wushu Culture Museum, Renmin University of China, and the Capital
              University of Physical Education and Sports Medicine, meeting his
              teacher&apos;s Baguazhang master, Zhao Dayuan, the 4th generation
              grandmaster of Liang style Baguazhang.
              <br /> <br />
              Mason became a Certified Trainer of Medical Taiji under the US
              Collegiate Taiji Federation (USCTF) in 2022 and has since served
              as a teacher for the USCTF at the behest of Dr. Daniel Chi-Hsing
              Weng, in their ongoing training courses for therapists and
              instructors.
              <br /> <br />
              Today, Mason pursues Taiji, Bagua, and Xingyi with a keen interest
              in health, wellness, and tradition. He has found a focus in
              sharing these treasures with the larger community through the UC
              Berkeley Martial Arts Program.
