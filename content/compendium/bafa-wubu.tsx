          Bafa Wubu translates to &quot;Eight Powers, Five Directions&quot;.
          Correspondingly, the eight methods are <i>peng</i> (ward off),{" "}
          <i>lu</i> (roll back), <i>ji</i> (press), <i>an</i> (push), <i>cai</i>{" "}
          (pluck), <i>lie</i> (split), <i>zhou</i> (elbow), and <i>kao</i>{" "}
          (shoulder). The five directions are forward, backward, left, right,
          and center.
          <br /> <br />
          Bafa Wubu is the foundational form of tai chi as it concisely covers
          all eight powers and their expressions in five different directions.
          <br /> <br />
          For beginners, this is a great form to start with to build a solid
          foundation in tai chi. For more advanced practitioners, it is also
          great to practice your expression of the eight powers in different
          directions, and you can slow it down to practice it as qigong.
