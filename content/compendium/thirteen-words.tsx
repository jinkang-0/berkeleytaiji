          Thirteen Words (十三字) is a qigong practice created by Master Li Xiu
          Yan, daughter of the Grandmaster Li Ziming to help everyday people
          reduce stress and improve their health. It includes a blend of Taoist
          yoga, breathing exercises, and meditation techniques.
          <br /> <br />
          One can practice this qigong as moving meditation, that is, using the
          movements to help focus the mind, calm the spirit, and regulate
          breathing. This is also a great exercise to help improve flexibility,
          strength, and balance.
