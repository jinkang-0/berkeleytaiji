          The Yang 32 straight sword form is a simplified version of the
          traditional Yang-style sword form, developed around the same time as
          the 24-form. It covers the essential movements and techniques of the
          Yang sword style, making it a great introductory form for those
          interested in learning tai chi sword techniques.
          <br /> <br />
          Due to its elegant and flowing movements, the Yang 32 sword form is
          often performed in competitions and demonstrations.
