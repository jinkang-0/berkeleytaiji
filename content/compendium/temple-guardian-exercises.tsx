          These exercises are the secret training techniques of Shaolin temple,
          practiced by monks to strengthen the tendons and muscles in the legs,
          arms, and core, to improve balance, and to develop the ability to
          withstand physical stress.
          <br /> <br />
          This set consists of five movements: green dragon shoots out of the
          water, fierce tiger pierces the heart, white crane spreads its wings,
          silver snake wraps around the willow tree, and golden leopard strikes
          the back.
          <br /> <br />
          Each exercise focuses on a different technique and muscle group, with
          the whole set designed to develop a well-rounded physical foundation
          for martial arts practice.
          <br /> <br />
          In class, we practice each movement once on each side, holding the
          still postures for roughly 10 seconds each. However, in your own
          practice, you can hold each posture for about a minute or maybe more.
          Of course, always listen to your body and do not push beyond your
          limits. If you feel any pain or discomfort, stop and rest.
