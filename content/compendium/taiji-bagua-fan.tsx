          This set was curated by Sifu Fong to provide an introduction to fan
          forms. It takes elements from the Bagua Kun Lun Fan forms and combines
          them with tai chi principles.
          <br /> <br />
          This form is a great way to learn the basics of fan movements, the
          footsteps of bagua, and the energy works of tai chi, all of which are
          required to smoothly execute the movements.
          <br /> <br />
          In the ancient times, the fan was the emperor&apos;s weapon of choice,
          as it can be deceptively powerful, easy to carry, and incredibly
          versatile. Of course, nowawdays, it is more of a cultural symbol and a
          great way to cool off on a hot day.
          <br /> <br />
          For our purposes, the fan is a great implement to learn the expression
          of energy onto an external object, which is a key part of neigong
          training. If you are able to open the fan with a strong and resounding
          snap without using brute force, then you have successfully learned to
          express energy through the fan.
