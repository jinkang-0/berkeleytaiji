          The tai chi ruler is a traditional training tool that was once a
          secret of the Chen family, taught only to disciples to accelerate
          their training. Now, thanks to the efforts of Sifu Fong and other
          masters, it is becoming more widely available.
          <br /> <br />
          The ruler is a moderately heavy wooden stick, about the length of a
          forearm, which is used to practice various tai chi movements. Its
          length makes it ideal to practice the various joint lock techniques in
          tai chi, developing coordination and precision in movements.
